# blox build

Validate & Build dataset

## Synopsis

The build command will ensure that your dataset is correct by
validating it against your schemata. Once validated, it will render all
your content into a single JSON file, which can be consumed by your tooling
of choice.
	
Referential Integrity can be enforced with -i. This ensures that any fields
ending with _id are valid references to identifiers within the other content type.
	

```

## Options

```
  -h, --help                    help for build
  -i, --referential-integrity   Verify referential integrity
```

## Options inherited from parent commands
